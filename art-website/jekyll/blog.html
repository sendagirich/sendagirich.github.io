The Ballet of Shibmata Shinhsokai exhibition at Atelier 485 Shibamata June 2019
June 12, 2019
</p>

<p>
The “Ballet” of Shibamata Shinshōkai
</p>

<p>
Street observation in Shibamata
</p>


<p>
The Ballet of Shibamata Shinshōkai aims to look at how art, urban research, history and community can come together to collectively approach issues of urban life.
</p>


<p>
The starting point is the metaphor of a “ballet” that the writer Jane Jacobs used to describe the daily rhythms, flows and interactions of Hudson Street in New York where she lived  in the 1950s
</p>


<p>
The exhibition will begin with sketches of the buildings on Shinshōkai street where Gallery 485 is located.. Visitors are invited to contribute by adding information to the walls with the aim of building up an idea of the history, social life, infrastructure of the street and its place in Tokyo.
</p>

<p>
Workshops and exhibition texts will present some approaches to understanding urban life by artists and thinkers and invite visitors to explore these ideas in the context of understanding Shinshōkai.
</p>

“バレー”柴又親商会
</p>

<p>
柴又におけるストリート観察
</p>


<p>
”バレー”柴又親商会の展示の目的は、いかにして芸術、都市研究、歴史そしてコミュニティーが一体となることによって都市の生活というものにどのようなアプローチをしているのかを観察することにあります。
</p>


<p>
ことの始まりはジェーン・ジェイコブスという作家が 1950 年代に彼女の住んでいたニューヨークのハドソン通りの日常のリズムや流れ、そして関わりあいを”バレー”という言葉を比喩として用いたのが始まりであります。
</p>


<p>
この展示会始まりはギャラリー４８５のある親商会の通りをスケッチすることから始まりました。観客自身がギャラリーの壁にざまざまな独自の情報をつけ加えていくことによってこの展示は成立していくのです。東京、柴又の歴史や生活や通りの役割そして商店街における存在意義というものを。
</p>


<p>
ワークショップと解説はアーティストらや観客たちによって理解されている現代の生活へのアプローチを示しているつもりです。そして展覧会へ訪れる人たちを現在の親商会への理解を深める世界へといざなうものだと確信しております。

Premis
</p>

<p>
The Ballet of Shibamata Shinshokai project started from a desire to bring together my theoretical concerns about space, community and the urban landscape with my art practice in ways that enable dialogue between the local community, visitors and myself and also as a way of exploring art practice as a form of research that can complement and extend scholarly research.
</p>

<p>
The title comes from “The Ballet of Hudson Street”, a famous passage in Jane Jacobs’ “The Death and Life of Great American Cities” in which she describes the daily life on the street as an intricately connected process between locals, visitors and physical spaces.
</p>

<p>
The project was produced at quite short notice. It was limited and there was much that could have been improved. However, it has given me ideas for future directions. The basic premise was to use the process of drawing, painting and exhibiting as a form or urban research that could be developed in collaboration with the local community.
</p>

<p>
The plan was to: draw all of the buildings on the street surrounding the gallery and display pictures of each building in the gallery as a street in the correct sequential relation to each other then to invite participants to make connections between places and add information to the walls of the gallery.
</p>


<p>
The aim of the project was to use drawing and painting as a form of urban research that would use my experience of observing and drawing the street as the starting point for collaboration between gallery visitors and the paintings to build knowledge of the street and local area.
</p>

<p>
Space
</p>

<p>
The starting point was the art space: Atelier 485 in Shibamata in the east of Tokyo. The space is run by Stephane Leroux, a long term resident in Tokyo, originally from France, with the aim of creating an independent art space that was not run on commercial lines or reliant on state support.  The space has grown to include a number of artists and participants and helped to form an informal community. An ongoing aim of the space is to include more of the local community.
</p>

<p>
Atelier 485 is located in Shibamata, an area in Katsushika-ku famous as the home of Tora-san, the hero of the Tora-san films and …..tera. The area is popular with tourists who usually take the route from the station to the temple along the shopping street lined with traditional style shops and restaurants. Atelier 485 is located on a shopping street adjacent to the station. The street is directed away from the temple and therefore is less popular with tourists. The shops and restaurants it contains cater mainly to locals. Residential buildings have been replacing shops that have closed and other buildings repurposed such as a recent cafe and Atelier 485 that was previously a clothes shop.
</p>

<p>
Form
</p>

<p>
My aim was to sketch as much of the street as possible outside, on the street, but due to time constraints, this was limited and I used photographs for the majority of my paintings. The time that I did spend on the street was interesting; there were  noticeable flows through the day and I could see nodes, such as shops that opened to the street, where people would congregate to chat. A number of people also came to talk to me, interested in what I was doing.
</p>

<p>
I painted watercolours [size], working at home. This was a departure from oil painting. Watercolours enabled me to produce pictures relatively quickly and potentially outside the studio. It also enabled finished images to be created in different styles in varying amounts of time. By using traditional materials and techniques I aimed to produce images that were easily accessible to a wide range of visitors.
</p>

<p>
I hung the paintings along the two facing  walls of the gallery in the sequence of the real buildings so that, although each picture was from slightly different scale or perspective, they were in the same relation to the other buildings as the real street. I aimed to use this as a starting point for building information about the street that visitors could add to by adding visual material to the wall. This material could be text, images or connections with different coloured string. The idea was to create something similar to a police notice board commonly seen on detective dramas. We provided a low desk and materials.
</p>

<p>
Research for me as extending the limits of art-historical research.

</p>


<p>
Theory
</p>

<p>
I intended to encourage and to give direction to participation by introducing some ideas from urban theory and artists responses to urban research. I decided to focus on four main themes: Jane Jacobs’s idea of “eyes on the street”;  Wajiro Kon’s “Modernologio and Tosaka Jun’s criticism. Kevin Lynch’s idea of “Cognitive mapping” and Fredric Jameson’s development of the concept. The last section titled “Text or texture?” that looked compared the semiotic approach of Roland Barthes  with Henri Lefebvre, who argued that we need a more expansive approach to understanding the city. I placed short texts (less than a full A4 page) on four pillars on the gallery walls with images to support the texts. Unfortunately I did not have time to translate the texts into Japanese. Through simplifying the theory it became clear to me that there was a theme of the contradiction between local - phenomenological approaches and approaches that aimed to understand larger, systemic forces.
</p>

<p>
Issue of linking local to larger forces is crucial.
</p>

<p>
Response
</p>

<p>
The response was positive for a first attempt, put together at short notice and provided lots of feedback on how to improve future projects. The format of small watercolours of the whole street seemed interesting for visitors but locals were interested but nervous about coming into the gallery. Communicating with the community more through a local cafe owner was useful. Children understood the idea of adding post-its easily and were uninhibited about participating.
</p>

<p>
Some visitors were interested in the theory side but I should probably focus on one idea more strongly then add other information in a file for more interested visitors. I should get any presentations of theory prepared well in advance. Translations are important.

</p>


<p>
Future
</p>

<p>
The format would work better over a longer period where I was based in the gallery and would benefit from including workshops / talks.
</p>

<p>
Problem of collaboration. How much to lead participation? Probably need a group of participants who are familiar with the aims.
</p>

<p>
Could be part of Shibamata Art World.
</p>

<p>
Could be a regular event.
</p>

<p>
Expand the range of media.  Performance
</p>

<p>
What role do images play in creating dialogue?
</p>

<p>
What role do specific places play?

I held a workshop for pre-school children at  KOMAGOME1-14cas during my exhibition there.  Tomoko Sekineruns Kids ART Studio every Wednesday above the gallery at Tokyo Studio or in the gallery with visiting artists when they are exhibiting.
</p>

<p>
We asked the children questions about the paintings such as where they thought the scenes were located, what time of day it was, what the season was and their reasons why they thought what they did.
</p>

<p>
We then asked them to find paintings containing certain aspects such as actions, clothes, expressions and colours.
</p>

<p>
We demonstrated how the children could draw their own evening view into a bus on black paper then make a window with clear plastic and a frame. We asked them to think carefully about the various aspects that we had looked at in my paintings such as actions and colours when creating their own picture.
</p>

<p>
It was very interesting to hear the stories that some of the children told around the people in their drawings and also in my own paintings. Also very interesting to see which aspects of my paintings and their own experience they found significant. For example a young, very quiet girl spent her time blending a few colours together which I originally thought was unrelated to the paintings but she had used the same basic colour scheme as in my work and had obviously been looking closely.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org82f9a70">
<p>
My first workshop. A step into the unknown; not knowing who would turn up or how the final painting would turn out.  Fortunately I had great support from Sachiko and Atsuko Shintani and Natsuko Funakoshi at all stages from planning, getting hold of materials and translating.
</p>

<p>
As a local artist I had been asked to hold a workshop at the annual Ebisu Bunkasai (culture festival) The idea was to present some of my own paintings then work with the children to collaboratievly produce a large landscape painting of Ebisu.
</p>

<p>
The workshop was aimed at elementary school age children. There was a reasonable turnout of children accompanied by parents and grandparents who were happy to join in.
</p>

<p>
After a brief outline of the workshop plan and presentation of my work I elicited some features of the surrounding landscape by drawing pictures on the whiteboard. We then asked children and adults, in groups,  to draw small pictures of as many things that they could remember seeing on their way to the workshop that day. After a few minutes we collected the ideas together, writing ideas on the whiteboard. We explained that we would have to divide up the words between the groups to ensure that we could include everything in the final picture. We then asked groups to choose at least two words to draw until they were all taken. We outlined a few guides for the drawings such as using all of the space on the paper and avoiding too much time consuming detail then set everyone off drawing. We stopped everyone after about thirty minutes then started cutting out the pictures and glueing them onto the canvas. when all of the drawings had been stuck on we demonstrated that all of the blank canvas needed to be filled. There was some creative use of the rollers to paint roads and railway lines and a few embelisments to the sky such as a rainbow and UFU.
</p>

<p>
I was pleased to see how the final image worked out.
