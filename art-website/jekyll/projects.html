Nomad art is a project which began with myself and Stephane Leroux transporting our paintings across Tokyo by public transport to an exhibition.  We started early that morning but realised that we would be hitting peak commuting time. With time to spare we decided to wait with our work at each station where we transferred. We had been discussing ways to open up public space to use for art but in a way that would not lead to confrontations with any authorities. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Tokyo-Nomad-Art-427939034024755/timeline/">https://www.facebook.com/Tokyo-Nomad-Art-427939034024755/timeline/</a>

The children learn about the work of British land artist Andy Goldsworthy. They look at photos of his work and extracts of the film Rivers and Tides and learn the English to describe aspects of the works such as nature nouns, colour, texture, size, shape and prepositions of place.
